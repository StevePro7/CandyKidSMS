It seems that I have the 3x command arrays twice:
01.	local static variables
02.	command object

Surely, I could combine and halve the amount of memory used here?
Also, would it be possible to double or quadruple MAX_COMMANDS?
and still have enough memory to store all this data rather than wrap

Undo command currently stops at index 0 and starts where command = 31
it should start at index before command 31 and wrap all 256 commands as necc til hits 31 to stop

Some are probable nice to haves!!

I need to decide wholeheartedly how I am going to integrate the SCREEN_LEFT_OFFET = 2
into all the background tiles and somehow integrate into the sprites tiles also

I hate tight coupling but I think it may be best to put in the tile_manager itself
rather than inject... it goes against best practice but "feels" right for this programming??
I'll think about it :)


01.
The 8th [yellow] candy in game_tiles.png could be reused as the 1st candy in main_tiles.png
because the first 2x candy in main_tiles are the same... this would give more variety


02.
Tighten up the level manager - don't need to store the value of the color of the candy I don't think
But need some logic to calculate about the free man candy, store the value and calc where to put
i.e. which mama is not moving and choose accordingly

IMPORTANT
I need to scale out the level_object so that 100 level data is in AA and 100 level data is in BB
rather than 50/50.. this way I could potentially have 20 worlds i.e. double the amount of worlds

As a nice aside:
I would like to have funky world names that relate to Joe Satriani album titles
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Satriani_discography

There are currently 16x albums listed here but there are lots of compilation albums that could use
prioritize the first 10 and then the second 10
