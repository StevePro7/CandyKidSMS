Some are probable nice to haves!!


00.
I need to decide wholeheartedly how I am going to integrate the SCREEN_LEFT_OFFET = 2
into all the background tiles and somehow integrate into the sprites tiles also

I hate tight coupling but I think it may be best to put in the tile_manager itself
rather than inject... it goes against best practice but "feels" right for this programming??
I'll think about it :)


01.
The 8th [yellow] candy in game_tiles.png could be reused as the 1st candy in main_tiles.png
because the first 2x candy in main_tiles are the same... this would give more variety


02.
Tighten up the level manager - don't need to store the value of the color of the candy I don't think
But need some logic to calculate about the free man candy, store the value and calc where to put
i.e. which mama is not moving and choose accordingly
