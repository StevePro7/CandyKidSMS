General
once direction is set then continue in that direction
if still moving across tiles then do not check for change in direction
if not at junction then do not check for change in direction

if moved across tile AND at junction then check AI Override()
if at special AI Override tile then do not check for change in direction

IMP
this logic applies for Scatter AND Attack


Home
logic to move LRUD as necc. to get out of home
then go to Scatter
after Scatter for X seconds then goto Attack


Scatter
once change of direction established then do the following:
try to find favored tile	i.e. tile in scatterTiles list
if cannot find favored tile then order scatter tiles relative to current position
and return first tile in the ordered list and find direction req'd to goto that tile
else
if found favored tile then get next favorecd tile from list and find direction to goto that tile

HARD
order scatterTiles relative to current position
find direction method - Pacman is deterministic


Attack
each ghost has unique algorithm to attack
