Trying to consolidate ALL the sprites: have all the smaller 16x16 sprites loaded but once I try to integrate the 32 and 64 size boss sprites they render different color so will have to try and "force" to use the same consistent sprite palette :(
Must read Platform Explorer devkitSMS blog I wrote to remember how to do this e.g. export palette and reuse

Later on in the day I tried the color palette but would not work!  Basically because the individual sprites / bosses had only 3x colors so this was overwriting in the same place... so after a lot of trial + error I thought of creating multiple spritesheets with 1x big boss and all the small entities on 48 x (46 + 6 * 16) sheet and replicate across 6x big bosses and while this still generated independent palettes per spritesheet it meant that I could have all the sprites I needed consistently!

I just had to repeat for the med boss and generate other sprite sheets but at least this finalized the sprites today

Spent awhile trying to get the stupid skull n' crossbones sprite acceptable!
Tried very hard to find the sprite in the "More than 50 programs" by Michael Howard as pretty sure there was a cool 16x16 skull n' crossbones sprite there...!
