One week out from the competition and I see major funky weird behavior.
Start and play all the way to the end and get game over then weird stuff

I sent an email to Claudio + Michael over the week and Michael did some debugging
Long story short it seems to be function pointers that cause the issue.

I have function pointers in 2x places:
command manager
screen manager

I used them in screen Mgr before in Platform Explorer without issue
so I thought that I may have exhausted too many screens and cut a branch and reduced them

However, I ran old and new version of the code and if I disable ghosts and do not issue any commands
myself and quit out then there are no issues at all
