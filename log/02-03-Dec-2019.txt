Have been working on code samples and slides for Retro Game Development presentation Fri, 6th Dec 2019
so have made a ton of demos and ported a lot of previous code to devkit SMS manager style
e.g.
CandyKidDemoSMS

today I got the prototype working for sprite clipping window
I won't be using the sprite clipping window API as doesn't work how I would like
i.e.
mask the static tile so that CK goes behind
instead I got code sample from sverx today after couple days correspondence

SMS_setTile( tile | TILE_USE_SPRITE_PALETTE | TILE_PRIORITY );
https://bitbucket.org/SteveProXNA/actionstuff/src/master/Personal/Presentations/_CodeAFTER/60_SpriteClippingWindow

instead I use white square and draw on black background but is black because the tiles use sprite palette
and CK goes behind because the tiles have tile priority
this is the solution exactly what I was looking for!!

SRAM
I got the original code sample working from this code sample from sverx
http://www.smspower.org/forums/16013-DevkitSMSSMSlibMissingRequestingFeatures#91899

but I haven't managed to port to my devkit SMS manager style
this is the line of code that I am struggling to expose

struct my_savegame *savegame = ( struct my_savegame* )( &SMS_SRAM );
specifically &SMS_SRAM
address of the SMS_SRAM unsigned char array
