Trying to wrap up the year at work and finish all tasks...!


17/12/2019
I created new github repo for StevePro7 for CandyKidSMSgraphics
and started experimenting with graphics esp. sprites

Initially I got the original sprites.bmp and got an XNA type program to scale but there were loss of pixels so instead I just thought dump into MS Paint and resize and worked perfect i.e. resized and did not blur any pixels... yah!

This evening I set about dumping tiles out of graphics load program of various sizes
16x16
32x32
48x48
64x64

this was to get some estimates on tile budget
